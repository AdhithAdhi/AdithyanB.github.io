#Projects is required
project:
 - p_title: Secure Banking using CaRP and Rabin Cryptosystem - 
   date: Mar, 2019
   discription: Many security primitives are based on hard mathematical problems. Using hard AI problems for security is emerging as an exciting new paradigm, but has been underexplored. In this paper, we present a new security primitive based on hard AI problems, namely, a novel family of graphical password systems built on top of Captcha technology, which we call Captcha as graphical passwords (CaRP). CaRP is both a Captcha and a graphical password scheme. CaRP is not a panacea, but it offers reasonable security and usability and appears to fit well with some practical applications for improving online security

 - p_title: Anti-Phishing Website
   date: Oct, 2018
   discription: There are e- banking websites who ask users to provide sensitive data such as username, password or credit card details etc. often for malicious reasons. This type of e-banking website is known as a phishing website. In order to detect and predict e-banking phishing websites, we proposed an intelligent, flexible and effective system that is based on using classification Data mining algorithm.We implemented classification algorithm and techniques to extract the phishing data sets criteria to classify their legitimacy
